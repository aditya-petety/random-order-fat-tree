# random-order-fat-tree

Run this with python nx_fat_tree.py depth degree iterations.

For example to if I want my tree to have depth 4, degree of each node 10 and I want to run this for 10 iterations, I run "python nx_fat_tree.py 4 10 10".

The output gives total number of nodes in graph, the max load in each iteration and the average max load over all iterations.
